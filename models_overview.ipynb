    "- GPT-4: A set of models that improve on GPT-3.5 and can understand as well as generate natural language or code. They have different context sizes and prices.\n",
    "- ChatGPT: A set of models that are optimized for dialogue. The performance of gpt-3.5-turbo is on par with Instruct Davinci.\n",
    "- InstructGPT: A set of models that are optimized to follow single-turn instructions. Ada is the fastest model, while Davinci is the most powerful.\n",
    "- Fine-tuning: A feature that allows you to create your own custom models by fine-tuning the base models with your training data.\n",
    "- Embedding: A set of models that can convert text into a numerical form for advanced search, clustering, topic modeling, and classification functionality.\n",
